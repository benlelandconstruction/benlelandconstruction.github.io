            <br />
            Ben Leland Construction has built a reputation as one of the Premier homebuilders in Seattle’s Eastside Neighborhoods.  This comes from a genuine dedication to quality and customer service, which we believe is unsurpassed. </p>
          <p><br />
            I am proud to be surrounded by dedicated “craftsmen” that follow our vision and clients that appreciate our integrity and the homes we build.  I believe a testament to our ability and trustworthiness as a premier builder is most apparent with repeat customers seeking our services, time and time again.</p>

      <br />
      As you know Kathy and I really loved our new home and all the beautiful features that were included.  After talking with our neighbors, we have become aware of horror 
    stories and complete dissatisfaction that some of them have had with their high priced builders.<br />
    <br />
    We really like having the chance to say, &quot;We have a Leland Home&quot; and watch the people acknowledge your fine reputation. It was also a key selling feature when we recently sold our home.<br />
    <br />
    Kathy and I were satisfied owners when we bought the home and we have come to greatly appreciate your continued customer care - three and a half years later!<strong style="font-size:20px">&rdquo;</strong><br />

      <strong style="font-size:20px">&ldquo;</strong>First of all let me say how happy we are with the whole process of building our home with you!  I'm sure you've heard it before, but I'll echo the fact that you have all made it easy and as least stressful as possible.  We would recommend you in a heartbeat (as I'm sure others have).  I am so pleased that we took our friend's advice and stopped looking for a builder once we spoke with you.<br />
      <br />
      Your concern for your clients shine through and you will forever be on the &quot;A&quot;
      list with us. I know you have had many more &quot;notable&quot; clients, but it is pleasing to us that your concern stretches the boundaries of only those more famous. We've felt like we've received RED CARPET treatment from the beginning.<strong style="font-size:20px">&rdquo;</strong><br />
      <br />
      </p>
      <p>Warmest Regards,<br />

        <strong style="font-size:20px">&ldquo;</strong>The Leland staff was very accommodating, professional and a pleasure to work with.<br />
        <br />
        The subcontractors, true craftsmen, showed up on time as scheduled and were also very accommodating and easy to work with.  Leland was the original builder of our home 8 years ago - it was a spec home.  Most of the subcontractors were the same that did the original construction on the home, which in our opinion says volumes about Leland constructions' work ethics and overall business dealings.<br />
        <br />
        The construction was completed on time in spite of being done in a time period that included Thanksgiving, Xmas, the New Year, and Seattle's winter top of the line.<br />
        <br />
        The bottom line is my wife and I are very pleased with Leland Construction and more importantly the finished product is fabulous.  As a result of moving around the country we have built or extensively remodeled 12 houses.  With our experience in building and remodeling we rank Leland Construction at the top and would highly recommend them.<strong style="font-size:20px">&rdquo;</strong><br />
